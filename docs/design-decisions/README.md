# Design Decisions

This directory records significant architectural decisions for this project, as lightweight
[ADRs](https://adr.github.io/) (Architecture Decision Records).

Each record captures **one** decision: the context that forced it, the
decision itself, its consequences, and the alternatives that were rejected
and why. A record's original text is never deleted-and-replaced — history is
preserved in place (see [Maintaining records](#maintaining-records)). A
genuinely *reversed* decision is retired by a new record that supersedes it,
not by rewriting the old one.

## Format

## Maintaining records

When a record drifts from the implementation, **do not delete and replace the original
text.** Keep the original readable as history and mark the change in place:

- **Correction / progress addendum** — strike the obsolete text with `~~…~~` and append a
  dated note explaining the change, e.g.
  `> **Correction (YYYY-MM-DD):** …` or `> **Progress (YYYY-MM-DD):** …`.
- **Status promotion** — keep the old status struck through and add the new one with a dated
  rationale, e.g.
  `- Status: ~~Proposed~~ **Accepted** _(YYYY-MM-DD: promoted — implemented in …)_`.
- **Reversal** — a decision that is genuinely overturned (not merely refined) is retired by a
  new record that supersedes it (`Status: Superseded by <NNNN>`), not by rewriting it.
- **The index below is the exception**: it is edited by **direct overwrite** (no strikethrough),
  since it is a derived table that must always show each record's current effective status.

Permanent records here are written in **English**. (Ephemeral working notes may be in any
language and are kept out of version control.)
